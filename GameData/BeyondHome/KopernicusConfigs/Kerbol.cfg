			description = Kerbol died on the 9th billionth year. Its thermal output from the initial explosion was over seven times the scale it was predicted. A sudden burst of heat impacted many of the innermost planets, scorching their surfaces. After a firey end, this no-longer-main-sequence star is all that remains of the heart of the Kerbol system. It now resides as a cooling white dwarf star with the most spectacular views, but returning here is no longer an option for survival. The only way forward is beyond home.
