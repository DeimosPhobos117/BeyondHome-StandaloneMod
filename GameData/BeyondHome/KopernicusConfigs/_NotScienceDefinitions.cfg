    @RESULTS
    {
        default = Looks like you don't get a special sarcastic science report for this planet. Think yourself lucky, you might have cut yourself on that edge.
        
        KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Rhode, eh? Looks pretty desert-ed! Ha. There should be a portal device to your le- wait no, wrong script.
        KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Planes are cool and all, but are you gonna, yknow, SET OFF?
        KerbinSrfLandedVAB = Of all the places to go, you chose to go here. Well isn't that just fantastic. Did you expect some special flavour text?
        KerbinSrfLandedSPH = You could be out there furthering our knowledge of the stars and you decided to pitch up to the front door? Fine, have it your way.
        KerbinSrfLanded = You've not even set off yet. Or have you just got back? Either way, what are you sitting around for?
        KerbinSrfLanded = Yup. Sure looks like sand here. I'm not sure what else you expected, to be honest.
        KerbinSrfLanded = Cacti, trees, the occasional oddly shaped rock. Feels like home.
        KerbinSrfLanded = Mmmmmmmmmmmm. Smell that? That's a different kind of wind. Ew.
        KerbinFlyingLow = The view is rather nice from up here, but was it really necessary to look down?
        KerbinFlyingHigh = The view is even nicer from here. Don't tell me we're going even further up?
        KerbinInSpaceLow = SPACE! Not really the final frontier since Kerbals have been here before. Are we there yet?
        KerbinInSpaceHigh = I can see... Lua? Ash? And I think that one there is Armstrong. Oh. My bad. THERE'S NO WINDOWS.
        
        LuaSrfLanded = The MOON! What a wonderful place. I heard that there were cool colonizing devices in the mountains.
        LuaSrfLanded = The postcards that I was sent made this place look a whole lot nicer than it does.
        LuaSrfLanded = It's a bit warm in here, I might open a window for some fresh air.
        LuaFlyingLow = Spotted any of those colonizers yet? Me neither.
        LuaFlyingHigh = "Flying high at Lua"? Nice one, the atmosphere is only 10km. What is this, an atmosphere for ants?
        LuaInSpaceLow = Wow, we're almost at the surface. Pretty neat!
        LuaInSpaceHigh = *winks* Get closer to the moon, what could go wrong?
        
        AshSrfLanded = Welcome to Ash, there are rumours of some colonies around here. Hard to miss. Just don't fly into them.
        AshSrfLanded = I wonder where this moon gets its name from? The ground is covered in...... Silt.
        AshSrfLanded = I dare you to put a finger in the lava!
        AshSrfLanded = Fun fact, Ash wasn't even known to exist until a few years ago. The guys who colonized Rhode were clearly in a hurry.
        AshSrfLanded = Your RCS pack won't work well here. Word of advice, BRING A LADDER. Love from - a future rescue mission.
        AshInSpaceLow = The window has fogged up. Can't see a thing.
        AshInSpaceHigh = We're quite far out from Rhode here. It looks so small.
        
        ArmstrongSrfLanded = Armstrong! Named after the popular high speed internet provider. No, I wasn't paid to say that.
        ArmstrongSrfLanded = Are those... bones?
        ArmstrongSrfLanded = Try walking up to one of those bone things. You might be able to sample its mineral structure.
        ArmstrongSrfLanded = If there's a god up there, WHY did you make these grotesque structures.
        ArmstrongSrfLanded = I wonder whether you keep pressing "Crew Report" just for the sake of it. We've done this experiment thousands of times, please stop!
        ArmstrongInSpaceLow = It's rather foggy, keep the speed down I might hit a mountain!
        ArmstrongInSpaceHigh = Ooo! Shiny!
        
        HydrusSrfLanded = Why are there no rocks on the surf- oh.
        HydrusSrfLanded = And I thought that Armstrong's rocks were weird. These are a whole new level of strange.
        HydrusSrfLanded = This would be an awesome place for a base.
        HydrusFlyingLow = Don't even think about landing on one of those floating islands.
        HydrusFlyingHigh = And it was all yellow!
        HydrusInSpaceLow = I reckon it smells horrible down there. Look at all that sulfur.
        HydrusInSpaceHigh = Well, that atmosphere looks thick. That sounds like a you problem.
        
        HydronSrfLanded = THIS PLACE IS YELLOW TOO, WHY?!
        HydronSrfLanded = The view of Hydrus from here is fantastic. You are on the right side of the moon, right?
        HydronSrfLanded = Opening the window seems like a fantastic idea right now!
        HydronInSpaceLow = Be careful of the mountains! They might talk smack about you.
        HydronInSpaceHigh = It looks fairly bleak down there, maybe we should turn back?
        
        FurySrfLanded = Super! Hot! Super! Hot!
        FurySrfLanded = There should be some stone arches around here somewhere. I heard they took 4 hours to form, apparently the process is called "Blender"?
        FurySrfLanded = It's a tad warm down here. Perhaps a thermometer scan would assist you here.
        FuryFlyingLow = I have no words to describe this experience other than extremely disappointing and not enough action.
        FuryFlyingHigh = It's rather red down there. Red is my least favourite colour.
        FuryInSpaceLow = Even from here I can feel the heat from inside this cabin.
        FuryInSpaceHigh = Can we go to Anger instead?
        
        AngerSrfLanded = It looks like this moon is in the process of being ripped apart. Can we go now?
        AngerSrfLanded = There's cracks everywhere. This is not normal. Everything is NOT okay.
        AngerSrfLanded = Now that you mention it, Fury does look nice from here, doesn't it?
        AngerSrfLanded = SNAP! One for the camera. Oh you thought I was taking a picture of the planet, didn't you.
        AngerInSpaceLow = This moon looks dangerous.
        AngerInSpaceHigh = I'm glad we're not going to Fury. We're not going to Fury, right? Right?
        
        ScaytheSrfLanded = Ooo piece of candy!
        ScaytheSrfLanded = These rocks look mighty fancy, take one home for the boys?
        ScaytheSrfLanded = Please tell me you're not just going to make us look out of the window.
        ScaytheInSpaceLow = Did you ever wonder how we were going to get back from this planet?
        ScaytheInSpaceHigh = I wanna go to the moon. Colourful, is it not?
        
        ScindoSrfLanded = They promised rainbows. They delivered. I'm disappointed.
        ScindoSrfLanded = Anything else here or is it just snow?
        ScindoSrfLanded = I take it back when I said I wanted to go to the moon. This place sucks.
        ScindoInSpaceLow = RAINBOWS!
        ScindoInSpaceHigh = Alright, snacks, snacks... snacks... Oh, you want me to take an experiment.
        
        RockSrfLanded = Do you even read these? Surely you've seen enough of them by now.
        RockSrfLanded = People say that the crystals down here are the same ones they use in those terraformers on Lua.
        RockSrfLanded = Steal some dirt, sell it on the market back on Rhode for incredible profit.
        RockInSpaceLow = Such a boring name for a boring planet, right?
        RockInSpaceHigh = Hey would you look at that! It's gorgeous! Quick, look away he's watching us.
        
        ProximSrfLanded = Started refuelling, had a meltdown, bon appetit.
        ProximSrfLanded = Not a rock to be seen!
        ProximSrfLanded = There are some pretty neat gorges on this moon.
        ProximSrfLanded = Of ALL the places we could have gone, you chose this one.
        ProximInSpaceLow = This place looks pretty mighty rocky. Good luck!
        ProximInSpaceHigh = Is there gold down there? No? Then why are we here?
        
        EidosSrfLanded = Caution, wet floor!
        EidosSrfLanded = Ooooo shiny floor.
        EidosSrfLanded = So those rocks over there are see-through? What do you mean you can't see them? Turn terrain scatters on!
        EidosSrfLanded = You could say it's nICE to be here. I actually like this moon.
        EidosInSpaceLow = Try to land somewhere flat this time.
        EidosInSpaceHigh = Eidos is looking nice. Let's go there.
        
        KohmSrfLanded = You can actually breathe the air out there! Only once, though.
        KohmSrfLanded = I was looking over the research from the past year's transfer whilst you were time warping. Yep, you're still an idiot!
        KohmSrfLanded = After spying on telescopic data from Rhode, there could be structures near the ocean here.
        KohmSrfLanded = I know what you're thinking, you regret coming here. Relax! It's not that bad.
        KohmSrfLanded = Sand. Rocks. Crystal things. Go ahead, fly into one, see if I care.
        KohmFlyingLow = Open the window, the AC isn't working.
        KohmFlyingHigh = Did you remember parachutes? I value being alive, however little that may be.
        KohmInSpaceLow = Is Kohm more green or more blue? Vote now on your phones.
        KohmInSpaceHigh = I can smell the chlorine from here. Take us lower!
        
        JadeSrfLanded = It's snowy. It's cold. It's like christmas but SpiCy
        JadeSrfLanded = Do you wanna build a snowman?
        JadeSrfLanded = Did you see that over there? Yeah, that. No, it's not a person.
        JadeSrfLanded = Generic science definition #4
        JadeSrfLanded = So I was reading the science reports from last night and I must say, HOW HAVE YOU NOT KILLED US YET??
        JadeInSpaceLow = Hmm yes, the moon here is made out of... Moon.
        JadeInSpaceHigh = I understand that we're trying to do science above Jade, but when was the last time you took a shower?
        
        AnsiaSrfLanded = It's brown, it's rocky and I want to go home.
        AnsiaSrfLanded = In fairness, this moon looks like it would be a fantastic place for a base.
        AnsiaSrfLanded = I like the moon and all, but can we stock up on snacks?
        AnsiaInSpaceLow = 
        
        
        GatewaySrfLanded = gAmEslInX sAiD thIs WAs a GaS GiAnt
        GatewaySrfLanded = Well if you thought these science reports were sarcastic, you literally just landed on the easter egg under gateway's clouds. Good job.
        GatewaySrfLanded = Let me guess - You're either on an iceberg or you're at the bottom of the ocean like an idiot.
        GatewaySrfLanded = Whilst you're down here you might as well take some screenshots and send them to me on the forums/discord. You found a badly hidden easter egg, enjoy the even worse hidden science defs!
        GatewaySrfLanded = There's no lore to be found down here, move along!\n\n No, seriously. There isn't.
        GatewayFlyingLow = Why are you even down here? Don't take science reports, FOCUS ON THE EXTREME CONDITIONS.
        GatewayFlyingHigh = This atmosphere is warm. It has oxygen too? Huh. Neat.
        GatewayInSpaceLow = This place is gorgeous.
        GatewayInSpaceHigh = So many decisions, so many moons, so little fuel :(
        
        KerbolFlyingHigh = How are you even entering a white dwarf's atmosphere? HOW ARE YOU NOT DEAD??? 
        KerbolFlyingLow = what the heck is going on LEAVE NOW BEFORE PHYSICS NOTICES
        KerbolSrfLanded = You shouldn't even be here, but well done. Thanks for playing.
        KerbolInSpaceLow = Are you sure you want to come this close to a burning ball of dead star?
        KerbolInSpaceHigh = Ah, our old home system. Strange how it takes us billions of years to advance our space program, isn't it? 
    
        JanusSrfLanded = Its nice here, but you do have a way to leave, right?
        JanusSrfLanded = It's good that green is a nice colour. At least, if you think so.
        JanusSrfLanded = WHY ARE THERE STONES. IN THE SKY?
        JanusSrfLanded = 
        JanusInSpaceLow = There are no clouds to see on the surface... So I would be able to see your ugly face in all its glory down there.
        JanusInSpaceHigh =
